User-Defined Data Structures


Arrays vs. Lists
Arrays and lists are the same structure with one difference. Lists allow heterogeneous data element storage whereas
Arrays allow only homogenous elements to bestored within them.

Stacks are linear Data Structures which are based on the principle of Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) where data which is entered last will be the first to get accessed. It is
built using the array structure and has operations namely, pushing (adding) elements, popping (deleting) elements and accessing elements only from one point in the
stack called as the TOP.

Queue
A queue is also a linear data structure which is based on the principle of First-In-First-Out (FIFO) where the data entered first
will be accessed first. It is built using the array structure and has operations which can be performed from both ends of the Queue, that is, head-tail or front-back

Tree
Trees are non-linear Data Structures which have root and nodes. The root is the node from where the data originates and the nodes are the other data points that are
available to us. The node that precedes is the parent and the node after is called the child.

Linked List
Linked lists are linear Data Structures which are not stored consequently but are linked with each other using pointers. The node of a linked list is composed
of data and a pointer called next.

Graph
Graphs are used to store data collection of points called vertices (nodes) and edges (edges). Graphs can be called as the most accurate representation of a real-world map.
